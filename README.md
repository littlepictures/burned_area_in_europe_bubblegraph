# little picture - burned area in europe - bubblegraph

## Background on this little picture
_burned area in europe â€“ an animated bubblegraph_

Monitoring wildfires from space is crucial for understanding their impact on climate, including the release of greenhouse gases &amp; aerosols that influence the Earth system.
This data-driven Little Picture uses satellite data to illustrate the annual pattern of burned area for European countries between 2001-2020. The size of each circle represents the burned area for the individual countries of Europe.
